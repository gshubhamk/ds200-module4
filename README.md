This repository contains data on
  - number of faculties in IITs as on December 2019 and
  - consumption of Liquefied Petroleum Gas over the years 2012-19

The source of these two data is https://data.gov.in/.

The following are the plots and observations for the above two data
### Bar plot for number of faculties in each of the IITs

### Scatter plot for faculties in position vs strength

 - From the first plot we can easily notice that older IITs have more number of faculties than the newer ones.
 - Second plot shows the correlation between sanctioned strength and faculties in position. And here, one can verify that the variation is quite linear. However there is still a noticeable difference between the two, as we go higher in strength.  
 
### Box plot for distribution of Consumption of Liquefied Petroleum Gas

  - The distribution in the above plot is over various sectors like domestic, non-domestic/industry/commercial, transport, power generation, agriculture, mining etc.
  - The median is fluctuating over the years whereas outliers are growing. The reason for the second is obvious as with time India has witnessed an increasing trend in consumption of LPG. Whereas sectors other than domestic might have been the reason for the former.
