This repository contains data on
  - number of faculties in IITs as on December 2019and
  - consumption of Liquefied Petroleum Gas over the years 2012-19

The source of these two data is https://data.gov.in/.

The following are the plots and observations for the above two data
### Bar plot for number of faculties in each of the IITs

### Scatter plot for faculties in position vs strength

 - From the first plot we can easily notice that older IITs have more number of faculties than the newer ones.
 - Second plot shows the correlation between sanctioned strength and faculties in position. And here, one can verify that the variation is quite linear.
